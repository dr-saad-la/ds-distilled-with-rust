# Introduction

What is Data Science?

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to analyze and interpret complex data.

Why Use Rust for Data Science?

Rust is a systems programming language known for its performance, safety, and concurrency capabilities. These features make Rust an excellent choice for data science tasks, which often involve processing large datasets and performing computationally intensive operations. Rust's strong type system and memory safety guarantees can help reduce bugs and improve the reliability of data science applications.

Overview of the Book

This book aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using Rust for data science. It will cover everything from setting up the Rust environment and basic syntax to advanced topics like machine learning, deep learning, and data engineering. Each chapter will include practical examples and projects to help you apply the concepts learned.
